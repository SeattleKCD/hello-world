# hello-world
Initial repository - Starter place for anyone perusing my space.

Hey, 
So I've been spending time learning Unity and have reached the point where I want to be able to CM my projects as well as share some of the content.  Now I'm learning GitHub to be able to do that.

My early projects will be small with the intent of using them to learn and expand my knowledge and capabilities within Unity.

My ultimate goal is to program some of my board wargames as a resource to play them online with another person, and have the game maintain the state of the game and implement the rules.
